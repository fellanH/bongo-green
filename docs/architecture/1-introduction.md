# 1\. Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for the FAL.ai Workflow Dashboard, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack. This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process.

## Starter Template or Existing Project

This is a greenfield project. While no specific third-party starter template was selected in the PRD, the architecture and all development will be based on the official `create-next-app` scaffolding with TypeScript. This provides a production-ready foundation that includes a development server, build pipeline, and routing, and is optimized for the chosen Vercel deployment platform.
