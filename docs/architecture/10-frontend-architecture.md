## State Management

  * **Structure:** State will be managed in feature-based stores (`src/lib/stores/`).
  * **Library:** Zustand.

## Routing

  * **Structure:** Routing is managed by the Next.js App Router's directory structure, using Route Groups like `(app)` for protected routes and `(auth)` for public routes.
  * **Protection:** Middleware (`src/middleware.ts`) will be used to protect routes based on Supabase session.
