## Key Organization Principles

- **Feature Isolation:** Each feature in `features/` is self-contained
- **Route Groups:** `(app)` for protected routes, `(auth)` for public routes
- **Component Hierarchy:** `ui/` for raw components, `shared/` for reusable ones
- **State Management:** Feature-based Zustand stores in `lib/stores/`
