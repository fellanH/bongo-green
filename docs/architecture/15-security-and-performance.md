# 15\. Security and Performance

## Security Requirements

  * **Frontend:** A strict Content Security Policy (CSP) will be enforced. Session tokens are stored in secure, `httpOnly` cookies.
  * **Backend:** All API inputs are validated with Zod. Rate limiting will be applied to expensive endpoints.

## Performance Optimization

  * **Frontend:** We will leverage Next.js features like code-splitting and Vercel's Edge Caching.
  * **Backend:** We will ensure proper database indexing and aim for \<500ms response times for non-AI tasks.
