# 1. Goals and Background Context

## Goals
* **Enable founders and product managers to rapidly prototype and validate generative AI features for their own applications**, starting with a curated library of high-performance models from fal.ai.
* Allow users to chain together these models in a simple, no-code visual interface to solve specific business problems.
* Provide a centralized location to view, manage, and utilize all generated assets.
* Achieve monetization as soon as possible to fund further innovation.

## Background Context
The current landscape for creating complex, multi-step AI-generated content is fragmented and often requires significant technical expertise. This platform directly addresses high-value business needs currently underserved by generic tools. For instance, a startup can build a workflow using a custom LoRA to generate dozens of on-brand marketing assets featuring their mascot, ensuring brand consistency across all channels. Similarly, an e-commerce store can generate realistic product mockups in various lifestyle settings without the cost and time of traditional photoshoots. These are the types of specific, high-impact workflows this application will simplify.

The application will serve as a powerful tool for users to build and execute generative AI workflows that solve real-world business needs. The long-term vision is to create a scalable, user-centric platform that can evolve to include additional AI providers, custom models, and a wider range of AI-driven use cases.
