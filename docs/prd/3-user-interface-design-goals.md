# 3. User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision
The MVP will feature a simple, static, list-based interface where users can add and configure workflow nodes by filling out forms. The immediate goal is functionality and clarity. The long-term vision, however, is to evolve this into a dynamic, canvas-based workspace inspired by tools like Figma and n8n.

## Core Component Strategy: shadcn
The `shadcn/ui` component library is **vital** to the MVP strategy. We will leverage it as the foundational toolkit for the entire user interface. Its library of production-ready, responsive, and visually appealing components will dramatically accelerate development. By relying on `shadcn` for all core UI elements (forms, buttons, modals, etc.), we ensure a high-quality, cohesive user experience from day one. Furthermore, since `shadcn` components are built with accessibility best practices, we gain a strong accessible foundation out of the box.

## Key Interaction Paradigms
* **Form-Based Node Configuration:** The primary interaction is a "Add Node" button that adds a new form to a list. Each "node" is a self-contained `shadcn` form with clearly defined inputs (e.g., text prompts, asset URLs) and outputs.
* **Sequential Workflow:** Nodes are displayed and executed in the order they are added to the list.
* **Asset Management:** A dedicated, filterable gallery allows for easy viewing and selection of generated assets.

## Core Screens and Views
* **Dashboard:** A central hub to view recent workflows and generated assets.
* **Workflow Editor:** The primary **list-based view** for creating, configuring, and running workflows.
* **Asset Gallery:** A searchable and filterable view of all generated images and videos.
* **Settings Page:** For managing account details, API keys, and subscriptions.
* **Billing Page:** To view usage and manage payment methods.

## Accessibility
* **Target:** Not a formal MVP requirement. However, by using `shadcn`, we will adhere to a high standard of accessibility by default.

## Branding
* **To be defined.** The design should be built with a theming system (e.g., CSS variables) to allow for easy application of custom branding (colors, fonts, logos) later.

## Target Device and Platforms
* **Web Responsive:** The interface must be fully functional and optimized for use on modern desktop web browsers. Mobile and tablet views should be considered for read-only actions like viewing assets.
